# hand-gesture-recognition
My new project detect the hand gesture </br>
I used CNN and LSTM architecture on JESTER-20BN dataset. </br>
Due to less computing power I trained the model for 15 epochs only.</br>
Here's the video of model in action <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/aasimbaig-mirza-058b28146_deeplearning-artificialintelligence-aiforbusiness-activity-6707909307075239936-hkvk" >VIDEO LINK</a>
